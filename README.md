# LibTesting-WiFi

Tools & wrappers to ease WiFi setup & use on both ESP8266 __AND__ ESP32 devices.

Is it just me?

Or is it _really_ that annoying how __similar yet not quite__ the various libraries for these 2 MCUs are?

## Required Libraries:

### ESP8266

* ESP8266WiFi
 * https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/ESP8266WiFi

### ESP32
